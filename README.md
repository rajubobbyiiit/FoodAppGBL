Food Recommend App
Restaurant Recommendation Engine
Assume that you are building a recommendation engine for your food delivery app and product team gives you the spec with following requirements.

Your algorithm considers following criterias
Cuisine of the restaurant : North Indian, Chinese, South Indian etc
Cost bracket: 1,2,3,4,5 (Increasing order from cheap to costly)
Featured restaurants: Restaurants which are officially tested by our app and recommended.
New restaurants: Restaurants which are onboarded in the last 48hrs.
Rating: Average user rating for the restaurant (from 0.0 - 5.0)

For every user that orders from the app we track following parameters:
Cuisine of the restaurant
Cost bracket

Top most cuisine will be considered as a primary cuisine of the user and next 2 are considered as secondary. Similarly, the top most cost bracket will be considered as a primary cost bracket of the user and the next 2 are considered as secondary.


We want to sort all the restaurants available in the vicinity and show top 100 unique restaurants with the following logic:

Order
Condition
1
Featured restaurants of primary cuisine and primary cost bracket. If none, then all featured restaurants of primary cuisine, secondary cost and secondary cuisine, primary cost
2
All restaurants of Primary cuisine, primary cost bracket with rating >= 4
3
All restaurants of Primary cuisine, secondary cost bracket with rating >= 4.5
4
All restaurants of secondary cuisine, primary cost bracket with rating >= 4.5
5
Top 4 newly created restaurants by rating
6
All restaurants of Primary cuisine, primary cost bracket with rating < 4
7
All restaurants of Primary cuisine, secondary cost bracket with rating < 4.5
8
All restaurants of secondary cuisine, primary cost bracket with rating < 4.5
9
All restaurants of any cuisine, any cost bracket



Given the below classes. Implement the getRestaurantRecommendation function in any language of your choice:

Enum Cuisine {
	SouthIndian, NorthIndian, Chinese etc.
}

Class Restaurant {
	private string restaurantId
	private Cuisine cuisine
	private int costBracket
	private float rating
	private boolean isRecommended
	private Date onboardedTime
}

Class CuisineTracking {
	Private Cuisine type
	Private int noOfOrders
}

Class CostTracking {
	Private int type
	Private int noOfOrders
}

Class User {
	private CuisineTracking[]  cuisines
	private CostTracking[] costBracket
}

public string[] getRestaurantRecommendations(User user, Restaurant[] availableRestaurants){

	// Takes user and restaurant while returning back array of restaurant Ids in the right sorting order

}
